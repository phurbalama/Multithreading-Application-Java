For running large( may run for long time) program
Threads will be created using two types:
    extends Thread
    implement Runnable
    implements Callable<Datatype> return the value after completion of thread

Each java class will have one Main thread.
new thread will be created on top of the main thread.

extends Thread => extends the class Thread. Multiple inheritance will not be available |
                    so if class has another parent, we cannot extend the thread.
implement Runnable => allows us for multiple interface
